- **Modified Logic**: [Describe key algorithm changes]
- **Dependencies**: [Any new dependencies added]

### Scraping Improvements

- [ ] Better HTML parsing
- [ ] Improved rate limiting
- [ ] Enhanced error recovery
- [ ] Better data validation
- [ ] Optimized request patterns
- [ ] Improved image handling
- [ ] Better progress tracking
- [ ] Enhanced logging

## Testing

### Scraper Testing

- [ ] Verified rate limiting works
- [ ] Tested with different network conditions

### Specific Test Results

| Exam Code | Before | After | Improvement |
| --------- | ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| [CODE1]   | [X%]   | [Y%]  | [+Z%]       |
| [CODE2]   | [X%]   | [Y%]  | [+Z%]       |

### Performance Metrics

- **Scraping Speed**: [Before vs After]
- **Success Rate**: [Before vs After]
- **Memory Usage**: [Before vs After]
- **Error Rate**: [Before vs After]

## Data Quality

### Data Validation

- [ ] All questions extracted correctly
- [ ] Answer choices properly formatted
- [ ] Images downloaded successfully
- [ ] JSON structure validated
- [ ] No duplicate questions
- [ ] Proper question numbering

### Sample Data Check

Provide examples of improved data extraction:

**Before:**

```json
{
  "question": "Incomplete question text...",
  "image": null,
  "choices": ["A", "B"]
}
```

**After:**

```json
{
  "question": "Complete question text with all details",
  "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "choices": ["A) Option A", "B) Option B", "C) Option C", "D) Option D"]
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

- [ ] Maintains existing JSON format
- [ ] Works with existing data files
- [ ] No breaking changes to API
- [ ] Existing scraped data remains valid

## Rate Limiting & Ethics
