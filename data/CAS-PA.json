Once or On Demand\n\nHistorical collection is typically used to capture past data or to initialize indicators with historical values. After the initial data set is collected, regular (daily, weekly, monthly) collections usually take over. Therefore, setting historical collection to run once or on demand is a practical approach to avoid unnecessary load on the system and to ensure that only the required historical data is collected.",

When there is no field in the indicator Facts table that matches the value to be bucketed\n\nThis situation arises because the Bucket group categorizes data into ranges or groups that don't directly correlate to a single field in the facts table. A script can dynamically categorize or 'bucket' the data during collection based on the logic defined in the script, accommodating scenarios where direct field-to-value matching is not possible.",
