          "content": "Security Incidents in ServiceNow are often created based on incoming email communications related to security events or incidents. Inbound Email Actions allow you to configure ServiceNow to create records or perform specific actions when emails with certain criteria are received. When an email matching the configured criteria is received, ServiceNow can trigger the creation of a Security Incident or take other predefined actions.\n\nEmail matching rules and email rules are typically used for processing incoming emails, but they may not necessarily be specific to creating Security Incidents. Notifications, on the other hand, are typically used for sending alerts or notifications but are not directly related to the creation of Security Incidents. Therefore, the most appropriate platform functionality for creating Security Incidents based on incoming emails is Inbound Email Actions.",
