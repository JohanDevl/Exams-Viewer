For example, you might use a dictionary override to change the label or description of a field, or to specify a default value or a custom picker for that field.\n\nIt is important to note that dictionary overrides apply to the specific field that they are defined for, and do not affect other fields in the same table or in related tables.

Import Set Tables provide a temporary holding area for records imported from a data source such as a CSV file, an Excel file, or a database table. Once the records are imported into the Import Set Table, they can be transformed and then moved to the appropriate ServiceNow table. The Import Set Table is typically used in conjunction with Transform Maps, which define how the imported data is transformed and mapped to ServiceNow tables",
