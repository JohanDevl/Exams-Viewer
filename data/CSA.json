For example, you might use a dictionary override to change the label or description of a field, or to specify a default value or a custom picker for that field.\n\nIt is important to note that dictionary overrides apply to the specific field that they are defined for, and do not affect other fields in the same table or in related tables.

Import Set Tables provide a temporary holding area for records imported from a data source such as a CSV file, an Excel file, or a database table. Once the records are imported into the Import Set Table, they can be transformed and then moved to the appropriate ServiceNow table. The Import Set Table is typically used in conjunction with Transform Maps, which define how the imported data is transformed and mapped to ServiceNow tables",

You can avoid these problems by grouping completed update sets into a batch.\n\nThe system organizes update set batches into a hierarchy. One update set can act as the parent for multiple child update sets. A given set can be both a child and parent, enabling multiple-level hierarchies. One update set at the top level of the hierarchy acts as the base update set.\n\nWhen you preview or commit the base update set, you preview or commit the entire batch. The system determines the processing order, and checks for collisions, based on the dates the changes were recorded, and on their sequential ancestry.

During this step, data is mapped and transformed to match the structure of the target tables in the ServiceNow instance.\nThe other options do play roles in the data import process:\n\nCoalesce Data (Option A): Coalescing is often done during the transformation process to combine or merge data from different sources.\n\nImport Data (Option C): After transformation, the import process is executed to load the data into the target tables.\n\nLoad Data (Option D): While not a specific module or step, the loading of data is part of the overall import process and typically follows the transformation and mapping steps.",
