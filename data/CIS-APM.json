(VIA GRC) \n\nHere’s why these metrics are crucial:\n\nCosts it takes to maintain an application: This metric helps managers understand the financial impact of keeping an application running. By knowing the maintenance costs, they can make informed decisions about whether to continue investing in the application or to consider alternatives that might offer better cost efficiency.\n\nCompliance to regulations and organizational standards: Ensuring that applications meet regulatory requirements and adhere to internal standards is critical for risk management. This metric helps managers identify applications that are compliant and those that need attention, enabling them to prioritize actions that mitigate risks and align with governance policies.\n\nThese metrics provide concrete data that support strategic decision-making, moving away from educated guesses to more data-driven insights.",
