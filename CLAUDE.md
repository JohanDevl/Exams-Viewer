### Update Summary Format
After processing each exam, the scraper displays:
```
üìä Update Summary:
   ‚úÖ New questions added: X
   üîÑ Existing questions updated: X
   ‚è≠Ô∏è Questions skipped (no changes): X
‚úÖ EXAM-CODE: X questions updated successfully
```

Requirements: Python 3.6+, `tqdm` library, write access to `public/data/` directory.

## Architecture Overview

This is a modern Next.js 15 application with App Router for ServiceNow certification exam preparation.

### Core Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand stores with persistence
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with custom styling
- **Data Storage**: Static JSON files in `/public/data/` with client-side processing

### Key Stores (Zustand)

- `examStore` (`src/stores/examStore.ts`): Manages exam data, question states, progress tracking, exam mode, and session management
- `settingsStore` (`src/stores/settingsStore.ts`): User preferences, application settings, and modal state management  
- `statisticsStore` (`src/stores/statisticsStore.ts`): Session tracking, performance analytics, and exam statistics

### Data Structure

```
public/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json          # Central exam catalog with metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [EXAM_CODE]/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exam.json          # Questions and answers
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ links.json         # External resources
```

### Component Organization

- `src/components/exam/` - Exam-specific components (ExamViewer, ExamSelector, ExamTimer, ExamHeader)
- `src/components/question/` - Question display and interaction logic
- `src/components/navigation/` - Navigation controls and sidebar management
- `src/components/modals/` - Modal dialogs (Settings, Statistics, Export, Favorites, Exam Configuration/Results)
- `src/components/providers/` - Context providers for theme, keyboard shortcuts, etc.
- `src/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components based on Radix UI
- `src/components/layout/` - Layout components (AppHeader with responsive navigation)

### Session Management

The application tracks user sessions for statistics:
- Sessions auto-start when loading an exam
- Real-time progress tracking during question interactions
- Sessions persist across browser refreshes
- Automatic session finalization on exam reset or navigation

### Question State Tracking

Each question maintains:
- `status`: Current answer state (unanswered, correct, incorrect, preview)
- `userAnswer`: Latest answer attempt
- `firstAnswer`: Permanent record for statistics (never overwritten)
- `isFavorite`, `difficulty`, `notes`, `category`: User annotations

### Path Aliases

- `@/*` maps to `src/*` for clean imports

### Performance Optimizations

- Turbopack for fast development builds
- Package import optimization for lucide-react
- Static asset caching with proper headers
- Manifest system reduces initial HTTP requests by ~90%

## Exam Mode System

The application features a comprehensive exam mode system designed to simulate real certification exam conditions with strict feedback controls and anti-cheating measures.

### Exam Mode Features

- **Timed Examinations**: Configurable timer with visual warnings and auto-submission
- **Question Selection**: Smart filtering with customizable question counts and difficulty levels
- **Feedback Control**: Complete answer hiding during active exam sessions
- **Manual Finish**: Early exam completion with double-confirmation safety
- **Progress Tracking**: Context-aware progress bars (exam questions vs all questions)
- **Security Measures**: Statistics and export features disabled during active exams
- **Answer Modification**: Ability to change answers during exam using reset-based system

### Exam Phases and States

1. **Configuration Phase** (`phase: 'config'`):
   - Question count selection (10-100 questions)
   - Difficulty filtering options
   - Timer configuration (15-180 minutes)
   - Custom exam setup via modal interface

2. **Active Phase** (`phase: 'active'`):
   - Timer countdown with color-coded warnings (15min, 5min, 1min, 30s)
   - Answers hidden to prevent cheating
   - Score display completely masked
   - Navigation restricted to selected questions only
   - Change answer functionality available via reset button
   - Manual finish button with confirmation system

3. **Completed Phase** (`phase: 'completed'`):
   - Full results display with score and breakdown
   - Detailed question review with correct answers
   - Navigation through all attempted questions
   - Auto-reveal for unanswered questions
   - Export and statistics features re-enabled

### Timer System (`ExamTimer.tsx`)

- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded progress bar (green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí orange ‚Üí red)
- **Progressive Warnings**: Toast notifications at 15, 5, 1, and 0.5 minutes remaining
- **Manual Finish**: Double-click confirmation system to prevent accidental submission
- **Auto-submission**: Automatic exam completion when timer reaches zero
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into exam header with progress tracking

### Feedback Control System

The application implements strict feedback control during exam mode:

```typescript
const shouldHideFeedback = examState.mode === 'exam' && 
                          examState.phase === 'active' && 
                          !examState.isSubmitted;
```

**During Active Exam**:
- ‚ùå Correct/incorrect answer indicators hidden
- ‚ùå Score display (X/Y correct) completely masked
- ‚ùå Community comments hidden
- ‚ùå Explanation text hidden
- ‚ùå Statistics and export buttons disabled
- ‚úÖ Answer modification allowed via "Change Answer" button
- ‚úÖ Question navigation within selected subset

**After Exam Completion**:
- ‚úÖ All feedback revealed with color-coded answers
- ‚úÖ Detailed explanations shown
- ‚úÖ Community comments available
- ‚úÖ Statistics and export re-enabled
- ‚ùå No retry buttons (results are final)
- ‚úÖ Free navigation through all questions

### Question State Management

Questions track different answer states for exam vs study modes:

- **Study Mode**: Uses `firstAnswer` for permanent statistics
- **Exam Mode**: Uses `userAnswer` for resettable answers during exam
- **Progress Tracking**: Context-aware calculation based on relevant question subset
- **Auto-revelation**: Unanswered questions automatically show correct answers after exam ends

### Anti-Cheating Measures

- **Interface Lockdown**: Core functionality disabled during active exams
- **State Validation**: Server-side style state management prevents manipulation
- **Answer Masking**: Complete visual hiding of correct answers and scores
- **Limited Navigation**: Restricted to selected exam questions only
- **Session Integrity**: Exam state persists across browser refreshes

### Components Architecture

## Mobile Optimization

### Ultra-Aggressive Scroll Lock System
The application features a sophisticated scroll lock system specifically designed for mobile devices to prevent any unwanted scrolling during user interactions:

- **Complete Page Freeze**: During button interactions (validate, show answer, reset), the entire page is locked using `position: fixed` on both `body` and `html` elements
- **Event Prevention**: All scroll-related events (`scroll`, `touchmove`, `touchstart`, `touchend`, `wheel`) are completely blocked during interactions
- **300ms Lock Duration**: Extended lock time on mobile ensures zero scroll clipping
- **Automatic Mobile Detection**: Intelligent detection via user agent and screen width
- **Sound Interference Prevention**: Audio effects are disabled on mobile to prevent `setTimeout` conflicts
- **CSS Reinforcement**: Additional CSS classes (`.scroll-locked`, `.ultra-locked`) provide bulletproof scroll prevention
- **Position Restoration**: Multiple attempts to restore exact scroll position after interaction

This system ensures users experience zero scroll movement during question interactions, maintaining perfect position stability.
