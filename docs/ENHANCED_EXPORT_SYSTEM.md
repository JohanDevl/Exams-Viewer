## Technical Implementation

### File Naming Convention

#### Format
```
{EXAM_CODE}-{EXPORT_TYPE}-{TIMESTAMP}.{EXTENSION}
```

#### Examples
- `CAD-questions-2024-01-15_14-30-25.txt`
- `CIS-CSM-enhanced-export-2024-01-15_14-30-25.json`
- `CSA-questions-2024-01-15_14-30-25.csv`

#### Components
- **EXAM_CODE**: Resolved from `availableExams` mapping
- **EXPORT_TYPE**: `questions`, `enhanced-export`
- **TIMESTAMP**: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` format
- **EXTENSION**: `txt`, `csv`, `json`, `pdf`

### Data Resolution

#### Exam Code Logic
```javascript
const examCode = Object.keys(availableExams).find(code => 
  availableExams[code] === currentExam.exam_name
) || 'exam';
```

#### User Data Integration
- Consistent exam code resolution across all export formats
- Proper handling of user notes, categories, and favorites
- Cross-session data retrieval for comprehensive exports

### Error Handling

#### Validation
- Empty question set detection
- Invalid filter combinations
- Missing exam data handling

#### User Feedback
- Clear error messages for failed exports
- Success confirmations with export details
- Loading indicators during processing

## Best Practices

### For Users
- **Use appropriate formats**: TXT for sharing, CSV for analysis, JSON for backup, PDF for printing
- **Filter strategically**: Export only needed content to reduce file size
- **Organize first**: Use favorites and categories before exporting for better organization
- **Check previews**: Verify question count and content before large exports

### For Developers
- **Maintain consistency**: Use `getExamCodeAndFilename()` for all exports
- **Handle edge cases**: Check for empty data sets and invalid states
- **Preserve user data**: Ensure exam code resolution works across all functions
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify all format/filter combinations work correctly
